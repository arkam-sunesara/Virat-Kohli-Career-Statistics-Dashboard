Virat-Kohli-Career-Statistics-Dashboard
I have created a comprehensive dashboard visualizing Virat Kohli's incredible cricket journey from 2008 to 2025. This interactive dashboard showcases key statistics, including his career average, strike rate, boundaries breakdown, runs scored over the years, and the distribution of hundreds and fifties.
It highlights his consistent performance across formats (ODI, Test, T20I) and his contribution as one of cricket's greatest players.
The insights are presented through visually appealing and intuitive graphs, making it easy to analyze his legendary career.
